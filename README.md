Hi, my name is Ridham (pronounced Rhythm like rhythm of the music) Zalawadia. Some say my typing
has a certain rhythm to it ðŸ˜†.

I graduated with a BS in Computer Science from California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo.

After that I worked on computer vision related things such as MLOps Training Pipelines,
Classification and Object Detection Inference on the Edge, Model Serialization and Benchmarking, etc.
These days, I work on Foundations of the Large Language Models applied to the Vision Domain (think
SSL on ViTs).

I use this blog to
1. provide data/insights into certain problem solving approaches used in research papers
2. write down stuff I commonly forget
3. share code/recipes with others :)

None of the posts are writtten by an AI assistant, partly because I want to track improvements in my
writing abilities and partly because I want to provide a non-robotic reading experience.

If you have any feedback for the blog, please open a github issue.
If you would like to reach out to me regarding anything else, please reach out at
