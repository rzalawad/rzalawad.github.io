I ordered an LSI 9206-16e HBA to power my 8x8tb and 8x12tb drives. That is a lot of storage. No, I don't
have a disease ðŸ™ƒ.

My primary goal was to connect the HBA to the PC via a PCIe Gen 3 x4 lane (x16 slot), then connect the
drives to the HBA using SFF-8644 to sata cables.

I bought an [Dell LSI 9206-16e 1V1W2 HBA](https://www.ebay.com/itm/196816910083?mkcid=16&mkevt=1&mkrid=711-127632-2357-0&ssspo=JZcP7KayTEK&sssrc=2047675&ssuid=ofudi9oytdk&widget_ver=artemis&media=COPY) from eBay.

All programs that were used such as `sas2flash`, the firmware files, etc. can be found [here](https://www.broadcom.com/support/download-search?pg=Storage+Adapters,+Controllers,+and+ICs&pf=Storage+Adapters,+Controllers,+and+ICs&pn=SAS+9206-16e+Host+Bus+Adapter&pa=&po=&dk=&pl=&l=true).
Most of these files are zip files and you can find a x86_64 ubuntu version for each program.
You can also get [lsiutil source code](https://ftp.icm.edu.pl/packages/LSI/sw/lsiutil-1.72.tar.gz) and compile it yourself (use the `Makefile_Linux` and run `make -f Makefile_Linux`)

Now that we have our utility programs in order, lets go into issues I encountered.

When I plugged in my drives, **no drives showed up**.
But the HBA was showing up using `sas2flash -c 0 list`.

I had watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLEVpU8u_Ls) by Art of Server on some specific issues with LSI 9206-16e.
My HBA had the same issue (i.e. the links showed as "off"). But, after resetting to the default settings as shown in the video, the
links were still "off". For some reason, the firmware's default setting was to have the links off
which seemed incorrect.

This made me think that the HBA had the incorrect firmware.
This HBA has 2 controllers. Each controller had version `Firmware Version: 20.00.11.00` retrieved using `sas2flash -c 0 -list`.
However, max supported version on BroadComs's site was `20.00.07.00`

So, I flashed each drive using 
```bash
sas2flash -c 0 -f 9206-16e.bin -b mptsas2.rom
sas2flash -c 1 -f 9206-16e.bin -b mptsas2.rom
```
After this, all the links were set to down!
```bash
root@pop-os:/home/bat# /home/bat/Installer_P20_for_Linux/sas2flash_linux_i686_x86-64_rel/sas2flash -c 1 -o -testlsall

But, even after plugging in my drives, they did not show up!

After much searching, I found that my NVDATA version was different for persistsent and
default settings.

So I decided to erase the flash using `sas2flash -c 0 -o -e 6` and then reflash the firmware.

After erasing the flash, my sas2flash output was like the following

However, my drives STILL weren't showing up!!

So there could be one of two issues:
1. SAS lanes were bad (unlikely since all 16 sas lanes were not working)
2. The cable I was using to connect to the drives were not working

I thought option 2 was also unlikely since I had tried with 4 different SFF-8644 to SATA cables.

[These](https://www.amazon.com/Mini-SFF-8644-Target-SATA-Host/dp/B01BKV4MSS) are the cables I bought.
I had made a glaring mistake and mistakenly climbed Mt. Stupid!!

I needed SFF-8644 Host (plugs into host i.e. HBA/controller) to 4xSATA Target
(plugs into drives). Instead, I had bought SFF-8644 Target (plugs into drives/backplane) to 4xSATA
Host (Controller side) cables.

After I got the correct cables, all the HDDs showed up!

Since I ended up changing the firmware, I'm not sure if the HBA would've worked with the old
firmware. I ended up taking the longest road to get to my destination and, in the process, learned
a lot! I finally have 160TB of storage for my data "needs".
